    <h5>
        Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code 
        execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are 
        declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or 
        local.
        It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code.
        Note: JavaScript only hoists declarations, not the initialisations.

    <p>Example 1
        <p id="demo"></p>
    </p>
    <p>Example 2
        <p id="demo2"></p>
    </p>

    <script>
        console.log("Example 1");
        x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

        elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element 
        elem.innerHTML = x;           // Display x in the element

        var x; // Declare x

        console.log("Example 2"); 
        // Returns undefined, as only declaration was hoisted, no initialization has happened at this stage
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = num;

        var num; // Declaration
        num = 6; // Initialization
    </script>
